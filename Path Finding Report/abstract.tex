\begin{abstract}
Over the past few decades the density of compute power has dramatically increased, whilst at the same time it's cost has dramatically decreased. As a result, much research has been done into the field of artificial intelligence, allowing it to be taken from a concept to a working product thanks to the increased capability and availability of compute power. 

This research will look to propose and analyse an approach to interactive and real time route planning for a robot designed for a capture the flag like task, meaning it will have to locate and retrieve an object returning it to a designated point, whilst all the time avoiding people moving in it's path.

This paper presents and analyses an approach to developing a real time navigational algorithm, named IOANNIS. The paper will present and critically analyse the algorithm's ability to effectively train an artificial neural network using a genetic algorithm, and the time it would take to come up with a viable neural network capable of safely and effectively completing the task.
