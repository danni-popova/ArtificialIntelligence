abstract = {In the Motion Planning research field, heuristic methods have demonstrated to outperform classical approaches gaining popularity in the last 35 years. Several ideas have been proposed to overcome the complex nature of this NP-Complete problem. Ant Colony Optimization algorithms are heuristic methods that have been successfully used to deal with this kind of problems. This paper presents a novel proposal to solve the problem of path planning for mobile robots based on Simple Ant Colony Optimization Meta-Heuristic (SACO-MH). The new method was named SACOdm, where d stands for distance and m for memory. In SACOdm, the decision making process is influenced by the existing distance between the source and target nodes; moreover the ants can remember the visited nodes. The new added features give a speed up around 10 in many cases. The selection of the optimal path relies in the criterion of a Fuzzy Inference System, which is adjusted using a Simple Tuning Algorithm. The path planner application has two operating modes, one is for virtual environments, and the second one works with a real mobile robot using wireless communication. Both operating modes are global planners for plain terrain and support static and dynamic obstacle avoidance.},

abstract = {Pathfinding in computer games has been investigated for many years. It is probably the most popular but frustrating game artificial intelligence (AI) problem in game industry. Various search algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, bread first search algorithm and depth first search algorithm, were created to solve the shortest path problem until the emergence of A* algorithm as a provably optimal solution for pathfinding. Since it was created, it has successfully attracted attention of thousands of researchers to put effort into it. A long list of A*-based algorithms and techniques were generated. This paper reviews a number of popular A*-based algorithms and techniques from different perspectives. It aims to explore the relationship between various A*-based algorithms. In the first section, an overview of pathfinding is presented. Then, the details of A* algorithm are addressed as a basis of delivering a number of optimization techniques from different angles. Finally, a number of real examples of how the pathfinding techniques are used in real games are given and a conclusion is drawn.},

abstract = {Multi-agent path planning has been shown to be a PSPACE-hard problem. Running a complete search such as A* at the global level is often intractable in practice, since both the number of states and the branching factor grow exponentially as the number of mobile units increases. In addition to the inherent difficulty of the problem, in many real-life applications such as computer games, solutions have to be computed in real time, using limited CPU and memory resources. In this paper we introduce FAR (Flow Annotation Replan-ning), a method for multi-agent path planning on grid maps. When building a search graph from a grid map, FAR implements a flow restriction idea inspired by road networks. The movement along a given row (or column) is restricted to only one direction, avoiding head-to-head collisions. The movement direction alternates from one row (or column) to the next. Additional rules ensure that two locations reachable from each other on the original map remain connected (in both directions) in the graph. After building the search graph, an A* search is independently run for each mobile unit. During plan execution, deadlocks are detected as cycles of units that wait for each other to move. A heuristic procedure for deadlock breaking attempts to repair plans locally, instead of running a larger scale, more expensive replanning step. Experiments are run on a collection of maps extracted from BALDUR'S GATE 1 , a popular commercial computer game. We compare FAR with WHCA*, a recent successful algorithm for multi-agent path planning on grid maps. FAR is shown to run significantly faster, use much less memory, and scale up to problems with more mobile units.},

It gives a detailed account of some of the popular evolutionary computing algorithms such as genetic algorithms (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), ant colony optimization (ACO) and artificial immune systems (AIS). The paradigm of fuzzy sets is introduced and two inferencing methods, the Mamdani model and the Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) model, are discussed. The genesis of brain modelling and its approximation so as to develop neural networks that can learn are also discussed. Two very popular computational intelligence techniques, support vector machines (SVMs) and rough sets, are introduced. The notions of hybridization that have aroused interest in developing new algorithms by using the better features of different techniques are mentioned. Each section contains applications of the respective technique in diverse domains.},

abstract = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) that use non-dominated sorting and sharing have been criticized mainly for: (1) their O(MN3) computational complexity (where M is the number of objectives and N is the population size); (2) their non-elitism approach; and (3) the need to specify a sharing parameter. In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN2) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed},

@techreport{Botea,
abstract = {The problem of path-finding in commercial computer games has to be solved in real time, often under constraints of limited memory and CPU resources. The computational effort required to find a path, using a search algorithm such as A*, increases with size of the search space. Hence, path-finding on large maps can result in serious performance bottlenecks. This paper presents HPA* (Hierarchical Path-Finding A*), a hierarchical approach for reducing problem complexity in path-finding on grid-based maps. This technique abstracts a map into linked local clusters. At the local level, the optimal distances for crossing each cluster are pre-computed and cached. At the global level, clusters are traversed in a single big step. A hierarchy can be extended to more than two levels. Small clusters are grouped together to form larger clusters. Computing crossing distances for a large cluster uses distances computed for the smaller contained clusters. Our method is automatic and does not depend on a specific topology. Both random and real-game maps are successfully handled using no domain-specific knowledge. Our problem decomposition approach works very well in domains with a dynamically changing environment. The technique also has the advantage of simplicity and is easy to implement. If desired, more sophisticated, domain-specific algorithms can be plugged in for increased performance. The experimental results show a great reduction of the search effort. Compared to a highly-optimized A*, HPA* is shown to be up to 10 times faster, while finding paths that are within 1{\%} of optimal.},

abstract = {The Next Generation Air Transportation System, or NextGen, is the ongoing transformation of air traffic control technologies and procedures in the United States. Two key components of NextGen are Performance Based Navigation (PBN) and the Optimization of Airspace and Procedures in the Metroplex (OAPM). PBN leverages state-of-the-art navigation technologies, such as satellite-based Area Navigation (RNAV) and Required Navigation Performance (RNP), to improve airport access, shorten flight paths, and increase en route efficiency. OAPM is a systematic and expedited approach to implementing PBN procedures and airspace changes. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is seeking to quantify the benefits of PBN. The approach is to identify all PBN benefit mechanisms, develop explicit models capturing those mechanisms, and conduct simulations to quantify their impacts under representative operating conditions. In support of this effort, we investigated the throughput impact of implementing PBN to mitigate metroplex inefficiencies. Metroplex inefficiencies identified in this study involved individual or multiple airports, typically occurred in the terminal airspace domain, and impacted both departures and arrivals. PBN capabilities included RNAV Standard Instrument Departure (SID) and Standard Terminal Arrival (STAR) procedures, and RNP Approval Required (AR) final approach procedures. The investigation included simulations to evaluate the throughput impacts of RNAV SIDs or STARs in addressing metroplex inefficiencies. We formulated simple, generic queuing system- based models of the baseline SIDs or STARs capturing the inefficiency, and the RNAV SIDs or STARs mitigating the inefficiency. We then extended the models to represent instances in the Northern California metroplex. Results show that RNAV SIDs and STARs demonstrated significant increases in throughput compared with baseline SIDs and STARs, particularly at saturated traffic demand levels. This paper describes the modeling assumptions, methods, and results including the quantitative throughput impacts and their sensitivity to traffic level, traffic distribution, and the in-trail separation minima.},

Given a fleet of vehicles, daily routes have to be designed in order to minimize the total traveled distance while balancing the workload of drivers. This balance has been defined in relation to the length of the routes, regarding to the required time. A bi-objective mixed-integer linear model for the problem is proposed and a solution approach, based on the scatter search metaheuristic, is developed. An extensive computational experience is carried out, using benchmark instances with 25, 50 and 100 customers, to test several components of the proposed method. Comparisons with the exact Pareto fronts for instances up to 25 customers show that the proposed methods obtain good approximations. For comparison purposes, an NSGA-II algorithm has also been implemented. Results obtained on a real case instance are also discussed. In this case, the solution provided by the method proposed in this paper improves the solution implemented by the company. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In 2001, Ken Perlin presented "simplex noise", a replacement for his classic noise algorithm. Classic "Perlin noise" won him an academy award and has become an ubiquitous procedural primitive for computer graphics over the years, but in hindsight it has quite a few limitations. Ken Perlin himself designed simplex noise specifically to overcome those limitations, and he spent a lot of good thinking on it. Therefore, it is a better idea than his original algorithm. A few of the more prominent advantages are: • Simplex noise has a lower computational complexity and requires fewer multiplications. • Simplex noise scales to higher dimensions (4D, 5D and up) with much less computational cost, the complexity is for dimensions instead of the of classic Noise. • Simplex noise has no noticeable directional artifacts. • Simplex noise has a well-defined and continuous gradient everywhere that can be computed quite cheaply. • Simplex noise is easy to implement in hardware.},

abstract = {Air traffic control in core Europe reaches the limits of available airspace capacities. Therefore new roles are introduced to shift workload away from the executive (radar) controller, who operates at the limit and is the capacity bottleneck, towards a more planning oriented but yet adaptive control function, the multi sector planner. This multi sector planner will be responsible for the expeditious flow through several sectors. The new role will execute a set of actions on both, airspace and traffic flows to reduce workload for the sector team or balance workload between sectors, so that overall centre capacity is increased. One of the central support tools is fine-grained, tactical, dynamic airspace management in conjunction with tactical flow measures. The study presents the airspace design process and tools that have been applied for the development of the future airspace of the Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre, based on the principles of dynamic airspace management.},

A redesign of flight paths in Las Vegas airspace has confounded a pure RNAV vs. non-RNAV comparison, but statistical analysis has allowed a partitioning of effects. Analysis of metrics such as altitude, flight time variation, arrival interval, and flight time and distance will provide insight into the increase in flight efficiency possible with RNAV. MITRE CAASD performed several analyses concerning benefits of RNAV arrival procedures in the terminal area, incorporating both simulation modeling and data analysis into the project.

The paradigm of fuzzy sets is introduced and two inferencing methods, the Mamdani model and the Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) model, are discussed. The genesis of brain modelling and its approximation so as to develop neural networks that can learn are also discussed. Two very popular computational intelligence techniques, support vector machines (SVMs) and rough sets, are introduced. The notions of hybridization that have aroused interest in developing new algorithms by using the better features of different techniques are mentioned.

abstract = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) that use non-dominated sorting and sharing have been criticized mainly for: (1) their O(MN3) computational complexity (where M is the number of objectives and N is the population size); (2) their non-elitism approach; and (3) the need to specify a sharing parameter. In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN2) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed},

The flight route is designed to have a short length and a low flight altitude. The multiple constraints based on the realistic scenarios are taken into account, including maximum turning angle, maximum climbing/gliding slope, terrain, forbidden flying areas, map and threat area constraints. The proposed DE-based route planning algorithm combines the standard DE with the level comparison method and an improved strategy is proposed to control the satisfactory level. To show the high performance of the proposed method, we compare the proposed algorithm with six existing constrained optimization algorithms and five penalty function based methods. Numerical experiments in two test cases are carried out. Our proposed algorithm demonstrates a good performance in terms of the solution quality, robustness, and the constraint-handling ability.},

Less air traffic con-trollers' workload is expected than classic airspaces, thus, corridors-in-the-sky may increase national airspace capacity and reduce flight delays. To design corridors-in-the-sky, besides identifying their locations, their utilization, altitudes, and impacts on remaining system need to be analyzed. This paper chooses one tube candidate and presents analyses of spatial and temporal utilization of the tube, the impact on the remaining traffic, and the potential benefit caused by off-loading the traffic from underlying sectors. Fundamental issues regarding to the benefits have been also clarified. Methods developed to assist the analysis are described. Analysis results suggest dynamic tubes in terms of varied utiliza-tions during different time periods. And it is found that combined lane options would be a good choice to lower the impact on non-tube users. Finally, it shows significant reduction of peak aircraft count in underlying sectors with only one tube enabled.},

This study sought to investigate the PA behaviours of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), evaluating the associations between clinical features and perceived barriers with levels of PA. Methods: A prospective study of consecutive HCM patients attending the HCM clinic from July 2014 - February 2015 was conducted. Participants completed a survey comprised of International Physical Activity Questionnaire (Long) (IPAQ-L) and Medical Outcomes Short Form 36 version 2 (SF-36v2), along with a “barriers to exercise” questionnaire. Clinical and demographic information was recorded. Results: The study cohort comprised 119 HCM patients [mean age 48±16 yrs and 68 (57{\%}) male]. Mean age at diagnosis was 39±17 yrs; mean time since diagnosis was 10±10 yrs and 43{\%} had an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Mean BMI was 27.4 (overweight range). Poor physical quality of life (PCS {\textless}40) was observed in 34{\%} and poor mental quality of life (MCS {\textless}40) in 32{\%}. The average (SD) min/week of PA were: Walking, 103±220 min/week; Moderate intensity, 46±108 min/week; and, Vigorous intensity, 33±80 min/week. Minimum Australian recommendations for PA were not met by 59{\%} of participants. Common barriers to exercise included “pain interferes with my exercise” (36{\%}), “my health isn't good enough” (30{\%}) and “I have an injury or disability that stops me” (30{\%}). Univariate analysis showed age (OR=2.8, 95{\%}CI=1.10, 7.37, p=0.03), number of reported barriers (OR=0.7, 95{\%}CI=0.58, 0.90, p=0.004) and PCS (OR=1.1, 95{\%}CI=1.04,1.15, p=0.001) were significantly associated with likelihood of meeting PA guidelines. Conclusions: A substantial proportion of HCM patients are not meeting minimum PA recommendations. This study highlights several perceived barriers to exercise thatmayexist forHCMpatients and whichmaycontribute to insufficientPA being undertaken.},

abstract = {The National Airspace System (NAS) is designed to accommodate a large number of flights over North America. For purposes of workload limitations for air traffic controllers, the airspace is partitioned into approximately 600 sectors; each sector is observed by one or more controllers. In order to satisfy workload limitations for controllers, it is important that sectors be designed carefully according to the traffic patterns of flights, so that no sector becomes overloaded. We formulate and study the airspace sectorization problem from an algorithmic point of view, modeling the problem of optimal sectorization as a geometric partition problem with constraints. The novelty of the problem is that it partitions data consisting of trajectories of moving points, rather than static point set partitioning that is commonly studied. First, we formulate and solve the 1d version of the problem, showing how to partition a line into “sectors” (intervals) according to historical trajectory data. Then, we apply the 1D solution framework to design a 2D sectorization heuristic based on binary space partitions. We also devise partitions based on balanced “pie partitions” of a convex polygon. We evaluate our 2D algorithms experimentally. We conduct experiments using actual historical flight track data for the NAS as the basis of our partitioning. We compare the workload balance of our methods to that of the existing set of sectors for the NAS and find that our resectorization yields competitive and improved workload balancing. In particular, our methods yield an improvement by a factor between 2 and 3 over the current sectorization in terms of the time-average and the worst-case workloads of the maximum workload sector. An even better improvement is seen in the standard deviations (over all sectors) of both timeaverage and worst-case workloads.},

abstract = {In this paper, a multi-stage ordinal optimization (OO) based approach is proposed to solve for a good enough schedule of stochastic classical job shop scheduling problems using limited computing time. The proposed approach consists of exploration and exploitation stage. The exploration stage uses a genetic algorithm (GA) to select a good candidate schedule set, and the fitness in GA is evaluated using a rough model, the artificial neural network. The exploitation stage is composed of multiple substages. The more refined crude models for evaluating a candidate schedule employed in these substages are stochastic simulations of various lengths ranging from very short (crude model) to very long (exact model). The candidate schedule set in each substage resulted from previous substage will be reduced gradually. In the last substage, the exact model is used to evaluate all the remaining schedules in the most updated candidate schedule set, and the one with the best objective value is the good enough schedule that we seek. The proposed approach is applied to a stochastic classical job shop scheduling problem comprising 6 jobs on 6 machines with random processing time of truncated normal, uniform, and exponential distributions. The simulation results demonstrate the quality of the solution obtained by the proposed approach in comparison with five dispatching rules. The results also demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

The new version of NOISHHH combines a noise model, an emission inventory model, a Geographic Information System and a dynamic trajectory optimization algorithm to generate flight paths with minimized noise impact and emissions. By introducing a variety of operational constraints, the resulting flight paths developed with the adapted version of NOISHHH fully comply with the regulations and guidelines applying to the design of Standard Instrument Departures and the use of Area Navigation. To illustrate the possibilities of the new version a numerical example is presented.

abstract = {Assemble-to-order (ATO) systems refer to a manufacturing process in which a customer must first place an order before the ordered item is manufactured. An ATO system that operates under a continuous-review base-stock policy can be formulated as a stochastic simulation optimization problem (SSOP) with a huge search space, which is known as NP-hard. This work develops an ordinal optimization (OO) based metaheuristic algorithm, abbreviated to OOMH, to determine a near-optimal design (target inventory level) in ATO systems. The proposed approach covers three main modules, which are meta-modeling, exploration, and exploitation. In the meta-modeling module, the extreme learning machine (ELM) is used as a meta-model to estimate the approximate objective value of a design. In the exploration module, the elite teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) approach is utilized to select N candidate designs from the entire search space, where the fitness of a design is evaluated using the ELM. In the exploitation module, the sequential ranking-and-selection (R{\&}S) scheme is used to optimally allocate the computing resource and budget for effective selecting the critical designs from the N candidate designs. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to two general ATO systems. The large ATO system comprises 12 items on eight products and the moderately sized ATO system is composed of eight items on five products. Test results that are obtained using the OOMH approach are compared with those obtained using three heuristic methods and a discrete optimization-via-simulation (DOvS) algorithm. Analytical results reveal that the proposed method yields solutions of much higher quality with a much higher computational efficiency than the three heuristic methods and the DOvS algorithm.},

TSS is a ground-based controller automation tool that facilitates sequencing and merging arrivals that have both current standard ATC routes and terminal Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) routes, especially during highly congested demand periods. In collaboration with the FAA and MITRE's Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD), TSS system performance was evaluated in human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations with currently active controllers as participants. Traffic scenarios had mixed Area Navigation (RNAV) and Required Navigation Performance (RNP) equipage, where the more advanced RNP-equipped aircraft had preferential treatment with a shorter approach option. Simulation results indicate the TSS system achieved benefits by enabling PBN, while maintaining high throughput rates-10{\%} above baseline demand levels. Flight path predictability improved, where path deviation was reduced by 2 NM on average and variance in the downwind leg length was 75{\%} less. Arrivals flew more fuel-efficient descents for longer, spending an average of 39 seconds less in step-down level altitude segments. Self-reported controller workload was reduced, with statistically significant differences at the p{\textless}0.01 level. The RNP-equipped arrivals were also able to more frequently capitalize on the benefits of being "Best-Equipped, Best-Served" (BEBS), where less vectoring was needed and nearly all RNP approaches were conducted without interruption.},

As scientific evidence for global climate change mounts, social and political pressure to reduce fuel industry. Operational improvements offer the ability to increase the performance of any aircraft burn and ??? emissions has increased accordingly, especially in the rapidly growing aviation immediately, by simply changing how the aircraft is flown. Cruise phase represents the largest portion of flight, and correspondingly the largest opportunity for fuel burn reduction. This research focuses on the potential efficiency benefits that can be achieved by improving the cruise speed and altitude profiles operated by flights today. Speed and altitude are closely linked with aircraft performance, so optimizing these profiles offers significant fuel burn savings. Unlike lateral route optimization, which simply attempts to minimize the distance flown, speed and altitude changes promise to increase the efficiency of aircraft throughout the entire flight. Flight data was collected for 257 flights during one day of domestic US operations. A process was developed to calculate the cruise fuel burn of each selected flight, based on aircraft performance data obtained from Piano-X and atmospheric data from NOAA. Improved speed and altitude profiles were then generated for each flight, representing various levels of optimization. Optimal cruise climbs and step climbs of 1,000 and 2,000 ft were analyzed, along with optimal and LRC speed profiles. Results showed that a maximum fuel burn reduction of 3.5{\%} is possible in cruise given complete altitude and speed optimization; this represents 2.6{\%} fuel reduction system-wide, Flights showed a larger potential to improve speed performance, with nearly 2.4{\%} savings corresponding to 300 billion gallons of jet fuel and 3.2 million tons of ??? saved annually. possible from speed optimization compared to 1.5{\%} for altitude optimization. Few barriers exist to some of the strategies such as step climbs and lower speeds, making them attractive in the near term. As barriers are minimized, speed and altitude trajectory enhancements promise to improve the environmental performance of the aviation industry with relative ease.},

This study sought to investigate the PA behaviours of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), evaluating the associations between clinical features and perceived barriers with levels of PA. Methods: A prospective study of consecutive HCM patients attending the HCM clinic from July 2014 - February 2015 was conducted. Participants completed a survey comprised of International Physical Activity Questionnaire (Long) (IPAQ-L) and Medical Outcomes Short Form 36 version 2 (SF-36v2), along with a “barriers to exercise” questionnaire. Clinical and demographic information was recorded. Results: The study cohort comprised 119 HCM patients [mean age 48±16 yrs and 68 (57{\%}) male]. Mean age at diagnosis was 39±17 yrs; mean time since diagnosis was 10±10 yrs and 43{\%} had an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Mean BMI was 27.4 (overweight range). Poor physical quality of life (PCS {\textless}40) was observed in 34{\%} and poor mental quality of life (MCS {\textless}40) in 32{\%}. The average (SD) min/week of PA were: Walking, 103±220 min/week; Moderate intensity, 46±108 min/week; and, Vigorous intensity, 33±80 min/week. Minimum Australian recommendations for PA were not met by 59{\%} of participants. Common barriers to exercise included “pain interferes with my exercise” (36{\%}), “my health isn't good enough” (30{\%}) and “I have an injury or disability that stops me” (30{\%}). Univariate analysis showed age (OR=2.8, 95{\%}CI=1.10, 7.37, p=0.03), number of reported barriers (OR=0.7, 95{\%}CI=0.58, 0.90, p=0.004) and PCS (OR=1.1, 95{\%}CI=1.04,1.15, p=0.001) were significantly associated with likelihood of meeting PA guidelines. Conclusions: A substantial proportion of HCM patients are not meeting minimum PA recommendations. This study highlights several perceived barriers to exercise thatmayexist forHCMpatients and whichmaycontribute to insufficientPA being undertaken.},

abstract = {Aircraft fuel consumption is a very large component of airline costs. Fuel burn is also very important because it is highly correlated with emissions and contributes directly to transport externalities. This paper calibrates fuel burn in kilos per seat per nautical mile for aircraft using the EMEP/EEA aircraft inventory database. We then employ the model with OAG flight schedule data to evaluate fuel burn by flight routes and aircraft types at a global scale. The paper shows comparative fuel use among different distance based markets as well as among a variety of routes in the long-haul market. The results show geographical heterogeneity of fuel burn rates among a variety of routes, while controlling for seat configuration and stage distance. The paper finds that stage lengths centered on 1500-2000. NM have the lowest fuel burn rates under current technology, fleet composition, and seat configuration. These findings, together with comments on the viability of long range flights provide better understandings not only for the carbon taxation debates but also for operational efficiency of current aviation markets. The lower rates for moderate distance flights seems to favor networks without extreme links, and supports the use of a hub connection scheme.},

abstract = {In the Motion Planning research field, heuristic methods have demonstrated to outperform classical approaches gaining popularity in the last 35 years. Several ideas have been proposed to overcome the complex nature of this NP-Complete problem. Ant Colony Optimization algorithms are heuristic methods that have been successfully used to deal with this kind of problems. This paper presents a novel proposal to solve the problem of path planning for mobile robots based on Simple Ant Colony Optimization Meta-Heuristic (SACO-MH). The new method was named SACOdm, where d stands for distance and m for memory. In SACOdm, the decision making process is influenced by the existing distance between the source and target nodes; moreover the ants can remember the visited nodes. The new added features give a speed up around 10 in many cases. The selection of the optimal path relies in the criterion of a Fuzzy Inference System, which is adjusted using a Simple Tuning Algorithm. The path planner application has two operating modes, one is for virtual environments, and the second one works with a real mobile robot using wireless communication. Both operating modes are global planners for plain terrain and support static and dynamic obstacle avoidance.},

abstract = {This paper addresses a variant of the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) that targets the balancing of the load carried by each active vehicle (balanced cargo VRPTW or BCVRPTW). A new approach, based on the free disposal hull (FDH) method of data envelopment analysis, is proposed; it consists of an initial, feasible route generation procedure that employs an effective heuristic for the VRPTW, followed by an iterative method for selecting routes on the efficiency frontier, according to the criteria of the BCVRPTW and the notion of non-dominated solutions embedded within FDH. This new approach produces, according to our computational evaluation, very good results for the BCVRPTW, and can serve as the basis for solving real-life vehicle routing problems. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The problem of path-finding in commercial computer games has to be solved in real time, often under constraints of limited memory and CPU resources. The computational effort required to find a path, using a search algorithm such as A*, increases with size of the search space. Hence, path-finding on large maps can result in serious performance bottlenecks. This paper presents HPA* (Hierarchical Path-Finding A*), a hierarchical approach for reducing problem complexity in path-finding on grid-based maps. This technique abstracts a map into linked local clusters. At the local level, the optimal distances for crossing each cluster are pre-computed and cached. At the global level, clusters are traversed in a single big step. A hierarchy can be extended to more than two levels. Small clusters are grouped together to form larger clusters. Computing crossing distances for a large cluster uses distances computed for the smaller contained clusters. Our method is automatic and does not depend on a specific topology. Both random and real-game maps are successfully handled using no domain-specific knowledge. Our problem decomposition approach works very well in domains with a dynamically changing environment. The technique also has the advantage of simplicity and is easy to implement. If desired, more sophisticated, domain-specific algorithms can be plugged in for increased performance. The experimental results show a great reduction of the search effort. Compared to a highly-optimized A*, HPA* is shown to be up to 10 times faster, while finding paths that are within 1{\%} of optimal.},
