Introduction:
IRIS (Intelligent Reconnaissance and Information Scout) is a mobile robot developed by students of the
University of Portsmouth. In its current form the robot is tracked and has use of a dextrous 6 degree of
freedom manipulator robotic arm affixed to its top. The IRIS robotic platform is a multidisciplinary project,
currently in its fourth iteration. IRIS is a ‘scouting’ robot and may deploy on varied terrain or in arduous
environments. The underlying aim is to build on previous work and to ensure IRIS is modular and scalable for
future development.

Task:
Develop an AI based algorithm suitable for path planning so that IRIS can navigate itself inside Anglesea
Building. Your work must heavily draw from available literature on path planning techniques.
